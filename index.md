### Assignment 1 - _due 10/13_
Assignment 1 is to build a compiler for regular expressions using Lua and Terra. The starter code and assignment description is [in the course GitHub org](http://github.com/CS448H/assignment1). When you're ready to start, start the template repo for your submission by following [this invite link](https://classroom.github.com/assignment-invitations/349e75dcf83aeebb9c0fefbc62a42dbf) (you'll need to be logged into your GitHub account).

### 10/8 -- IR design, transformations, and code generation

* [Slides](IRs-transforms-codegen.pdf)
* [Expression language example code](http://github.com/CS448h/cs448h.github.com/tree/master/ir-codegen-example)

### 10/15 -- How to read a research paper

Read the following paper on Halide.

Think about it critically using the web site on critical thinking as a guide.
What are the goals of the work, what is the specific problem being solved,
what are the assumptions behind the work,
are there new concepts or algorithms in the paper,
what is the proposed solution,
what evidence is given that the solution works,
what interpretation or inference is done in support of the conclusions,
and finally, what are the implications and consequences of this research.
Pat will lead a discussion of the paper in class.
Be prepared to orally answer the above questions.
Consult the guide for additional questions that might pertain
to this work.

### Assignment 2 - _due 10/27_
Assignment 2 walks you through the process of optimizing an image processing language through IR design and transformations. The  starter code is availiable [on the course github page](http://github.com/CS448H/assignment2).
